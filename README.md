# Well hello there ðŸ‘‹
Come on in!
 
I am Dan Bradley, a data analyst in the Philly area.  I have explored lots of open data sets and coded some fun Python projects over the years but never shared any of that work or analysis publicly, until now!

[Philly Auto Crash Analysis](https://github.com/datadan0/phila-auto-crash) \
Pennsylvania has detailed auto crash data going back to 2001.  My analysis focuses on Philadelphia between the years of 2019-2023.  I will be adding on to this gradually over time.

[Binary Thermostat](https://github.com/datadan0/binary-thermostat) \
This is a silly Arduino project that I worked on.  It used a thermometer sensor to detect the temperature.  I converted the temperature to binary and output it to LED lights.  Not the most practical project.
